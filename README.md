This is [Proof of Volunteer Protocol (POVP)](https://helpandgrow.notion.site/Proof-of-Volunteer-Protocol-POVP-94cdf9e1e9f94b60b0be8ad80dc29058) project, a Web3 + AI tool for NGO and Social Enterprise to increase the scope and improve the sustainability.

Help & Grow Community is a socially responsible community that aims to support NGOs and social enterprises around the world in their mission to help more children in need, using the power of Web3 and AI. We are committed to promoting environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles and incorporating them into our community's practices.

To achieve our goals, Help & Grow Community has been organizing a series of events, workshops, and bootcamps since November 22. This includes 7+ offline Web3 sharing events, 6+ Web3 workshops, and 2+ product building bootcamps. These events have been highly successful in bringing together like-minded individuals who are passionate about using technology for social good.

At Help & Grow Community, we believe that Web3 non-financial innovation has enormous potential to make a positive impact on society. Unlike traditional financial applications like DeFi, we are exploring ways to leverage blockchain and AI to serve underserved organizations and people, such as digital up-skilling and social inclusion. We are constantly researching and experimenting with new technologies to find innovative solutions that can help us achieve our goals.

To make a greater contribution to society, we are exploring organizational structure innovations that can help us become more effective and efficient in our mission. Our goal is to create a sustainable and scalable model that can be replicated in different parts of the world to help as many children in need as possible.
